# WDI Project 4: Group Project: 

**Build a web-based, CRUD application using Python with Django and React, in groups.**

## Groups:

* Steve Badal Justin
* Jared Stevie Jay
* Eugene Ron Alex David 

## Objectives

**Build and deploy an app that has a RESTful API in django and then create a single page React application that consumes your API.**

**Presentations will be Wednesday (August 22, 2018) mid afternoon.**

## Tech Requirements

You will be expected to use the following technologies to implement this project:

- **Django RESTful APIs**: A complete Django REST API
- **React**: A React application that consumes your API. 
- **Model Relations**: Most have at least two models (*besides* users) that are related in some fashion.
- **PostgreSQL**: Your app will need to persist data. 
- **Mobile First**: App most be styled mobile first, and use either a grid system of flexbox for positioning.

- **API DOCS** - Must complete a `README.md` for your back end describing your api end points and their corresponding response
- **DEPLOYED** - The React app and Django app must deployed to heroku separately (yes you can figure this out on your own!)


STRETCH GOALS

- **CSS & Design**: Your app should be pleasing to look at. Your design should take usability into account.
- **JavaScript**: Your app should have some interactivity on the front end -- DOM manipulation, Dope Animation, etc.
- **Auth**: Take advantage of Django's built in Auth. 
- **A third party API**:  like Twilio, or OMBD, Google Maps, etc. (Maybe make the api call from your server, or create an express service that does it for you :), that'd be rad! 
- **Express** - Create a seperate express API to integrate with, maybe an old project thats related
- **JSON WEB TOKENS** - intergrate JSON web tokens with express

Here's a description of an example project: [Forum](https://git.generalassemb.ly/WDIplus-ATX/project-2-express/blob/master/example-app-description.md)

## Project 4 Proposals

The following are **requirements** for your Project 4 Proposal

- **ERD diagrams** -draw out the tables & columns you plan to use in your database. Here's [a resource](http://www.bridging-the-gap.com/erd-entity-relationship-diagram/) on creating an ERD (an Entity Relationship Diagram, or database diagram). 
- **Wireframes** - detail the flow of your app through wireframes, viewable from the `README.md` for your front end React app
  * You can choose whether you want to whiteboard the wireframes or use some program.
- Routes - design the HTTP route architecture of your app. This should look something like [this](https://cdn.lynda.com/video/159165-107-635293993475267315_338x600_thumb.jpg)
- **User Stories** (and data flow) - You should have very explicit and granular user stories describing all the things a user could do and behavior they should expect. You should be able to connect your user stories directly to your wireframes.  Your entire group (each member) should be able to clearly discuss the architecture of your app, and how the data it uses will flow among the components.
- For this project we want you to use [Trello](trello.com). Give us a link to a Trello board with all of your User Stories as items on the Trello board. Your columns should be Todo, In Progress, and Complete. [Here's a good resource on using Trello for Kanban](https://blog.hubstaff.com/kanban-with-trello/).  
  - Make sure the trello board is public so we can see it
  - Task management is *especially* crucial for group work. Spend some extra time on this and *use it throughout the project*

## Deliverables

- A full CRUD app, with create, edit, update, and delete functionality, with both front and back ends hosted in separate deployments on Heroku.  You know now that even an MVP can be very difficult to achieve so you are expected to scope and prioritize carefully to be sure you deliver a functional MVP.  
- **Two** public repositories (one for front end, one for back end/API) on github.com with your code for this project and a thorough commit history dating back to the beginning of the project, reflecting use of collaborative git (branching & merging, etc)
- A thorough `README.md` file for the React app that contains the following:
    - The project's name and description and an explanation of what problem it solves and why it was made
    - Your wireframes and user stories
    - The technologies, APIs, and modules you used and a description of each
    - Requirements for development, deployment, and installation
    - Forthcoming features you plan to add
    - Instructions for downloading the code and running it on localhost
    - A contributors section that list everyone that worked on the project
    - A link to the deployed site
- A `README.md` file for the API that contains the following:
    - information about each end point: 
      - how to format requests (HTTP method? URL query string format? Information (or not) in the request body?)
      - structure and data in of the response expected from the API assuming a user follows the request format you specified
    - A contributors section that list everyone that worked on the project
    - A link to the deployed API
- A presentation in class that:
    - Is 10 minutes in length
    - Is meaningful to someone who isn't a developer
    - Explains what problem, desire, need, or pain point your app addresses and how
    - Has each member of the group talking about what they worked on
    - Shows off the features of the app you're most proud of
    - Explains one or two technical details
    - Explains one or two technical challenges and how they were overcome
    - Explains which improvements you might make
    - Has been thought through (planned and maybe even rehearsed) beforehand
    - Focuses on the MVP functionality you got built, and contains basically no prattling on about how you hoped to get something done but didn't, and frames things that aren't functional as forthcoming features.


## Help
Reach out to your peers! Collaborate! Help your fellow students! If you've done that, and still have been stuck for more than an hour, reach out to your instructors!

## Keep in Mind

**You are going to encounter a ton of unexpected errors and problems.**

Expect to come up against a lot of what can *seem* like roadblocks. Resist the urge to get frustrated. These are amazing learning opportunities. A lot of students treat errors during projects as just getting in the way of "finishing". The point of this project is **not** to finish everything; the point is to integrate your knowledge and deepen your understanding of how to put apps together.

Errors often provide the most valuable source of information about what we don't yet understand. Seeing an error as "it's not working" and randomly changing code until "it works" won't teach you anything. Spending time thoughtfully debugging issues is a fantastic investment that will lead to greater mastery and understanding.

If you feel yourself getting frustrated or mad, take a walk! Get some tea! **Go outside for 10 minutes.** No one can think clearly when they are frustrated, and it will all be there for you when you get back. It's seriously better to take too many breaks than too few. 

You don't know everything there is to know, and you never will. But you know how to do a **lot** of things, and we want you to focus on building from scratch using what you know. When you build the parts of an app yourself, you have much more of an understanding of how it works and how to integrate it in your app than if you mindlessly code along with a YouTube video and just hope it plugs in to your project. 

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, and other proposal requirements as specified above? Did you use source control (Git) as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)? Did you use merging and branching in a meaningful way? Did you strive to have open and meaningful communcation and maintain a sensible project management pattern? 

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, indentation, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to public URLs using Heroku?

* __Presentation__: Note: this is not graded this time, but is part of the project. Did you present your app, your code, and your project-making experience clearly and effectively to the class? See notes above. 

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a score for each section between:

| Score          | Expectations   |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| **0**          | _Incomplete._  |
| **1**          | _Does not meet expectations._ |
| **2**          | _Meets expectations, good job!_ |
| **3**          | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_ |

This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

### A Note on Plagiarism

Plagiarism is a serious offense and grounds for expulsion.

You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and stackoverflow, for help. However, it is NOT ACCEPTABLE TO COPY another person's code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.

Small snippets of code that solve small problems taken from Stack Overflow are generally an exception to this rule. If you aren't sure, it is **your** responsibility to **ASK**. To be on the safe side, why not credit the person/resource you got the code from in a comment, and let an instructor take a look at it.
